# Zomato Explora# 🍽️ Zomato Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project provides an in-depth exploratory data analysis of the Zomato restaurant dataset. The analysis uncovers insights about restaurant ratings, country and city distributions, currency usage, and market competition, helping stakeholders make informed business decisions.

## 📁 Project Structure

- 📊 **Analysis.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing all data analysis, visualizations, and observations.
- 🗃️ **zomato.csv**: Primary dataset with restaurant information.
- 🌍 **Country-Code.xlsx**: Supplementary file mapping country codes to country names.

## 🔑 Key Insights

- 🌏 **Country Distribution**: Most Zomato transactions are from India, followed by the United States and the United Kingdom.
- ⭐ **Ratings Analysis**: The majority of ratings fall between 2.7 and 3.9. Very few ratings are in the 4.0–5.0 and 0.0–1.9 ranges. Many users do not rate restaurants.
- ⚪ **Zero Ratings**: India has the highest number of zero (white) ratings.
- 💱 **Currency Usage**: Each country uses its own currency for transactions.
- 🏙️ **City Distribution**: The top 5 cities contribute the most to Zomato transactions.
- 🚀 **Market Opportunity**: Mohali, India, has the least competition, making it a promising location for new restaurants.
